The output you're seeing is from the `pmap` command, which reports the memory map of a process. The memory map shows how a process's memory is organized into different segments, including where the executable code, libraries, stack, and heap are located.

Here's a breakdown of the `pmap 26299` output you provided:

### Breakdown of Output

1. **Process Information**
   - **26299:** This is the Process ID (PID) for which the memory map is being displayed.
   - **Command line:** `/home/castle-ubuntu/os-projects/ostep-homework/vm-intro/memory-user 1024 100` â€” This indicates the command that started the process.

2. **Memory Segments**
   - The first column lists the starting address of each memory segment.
   - The second column lists the size of the segment in kilobytes (K).
   - The third column describes the permissions associated with each segment:
     - `r` = readable
     - `w` = writable
     - `x` = executable
   - The last column describes what the segment is associated with (e.g., the executable, shared libraries, anonymous memory).

### Example Segments

1. **Executable Code and Data**
   - `0000556a26434000      4K r---- memory-user`
   - `0000556a26435000      4K r-x-- memory-user`
   - `0000556a26438000      4K rw--- memory-user`
   - These segments correspond to different parts of the `memory-user` executable:
     - Read-only (`r----`)
     - Executable code (`r-x--`)
     - Writable data (`rw---`)

2. **Anonymous Memory (`[ anon ]`)**
   - `00007fa4533a7000 1048592K rw---   [ anon ]`
   - `00007fa4935b0000     52K rw---   [ anon ]`
   - These are large blocks of memory allocated anonymously (e.g., through `malloc()`). The biggest segment here, `1048592K` (around 1 GB), is likely where your program's allocated array resides, since you allocated 1024 MB (1 GB) in your program.

3. **Shared Libraries (`libc.so.6`, `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`)**
   - `00007fa4933ab000    160K r---- libc.so.6`
   - `00007fa4935c5000      4K r---- ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`
   - These are segments related to shared libraries loaded by the process. `libc.so.6` is the C standard library, and `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` is the dynamic linker/loader.

4. **Stack**
   - `00007ffe0502d000    136K rw---   [ stack ]`
   - This segment represents the process's stack, which is used for function calls, local variables, and more.

5. **Total Memory Usage**
   - `total          1051264K`
   - This line at the bottom shows the total memory mapped by the process, which in this case is 1,051,264 KB, or about 1 GB. This matches the memory allocated in your program plus the memory used by the executable, shared libraries, and other overhead.

### Conclusion
The `pmap` command is useful for seeing how a process's memory is laid out, which is particularly helpful when debugging memory usage or investigating memory leaks. The output shows the different types of memory segments used by the process, including where the executable code is stored, where the process's heap and stack are, and how much memory is being consumed by each segment.
